## Welcome to our HackMIT 2024 project, EcoEats!

### Description 
#### - A resourceful online food market where people can donate or sell sealed & unexpired goods

### Inspiration
#### - Food waste and food insecurity harm communities, so we set out to create a sustainable solution that connects people to reduce waste while supporting those in need

### What it does
#### - Our project is an online marketplace where people can donate, buy, or sell various food goods like snacks, beverages, popular pantry staples, and condiments, all within their local community

### How we built it
#### - We built it using React, CSS, and Convex!!

### Challenges we ran into
#### - We faced challenges determining what features we should implement and prioritize for the best user experience, while also integrating and using new platforms like Convex and Clerk

### Accomplishments 
#### - We're very proud to have built our very first full-stack website from scratch!! It was also very fulfilling to see our idea come to life :) We are very passionate about eliminating food waste

### What we learned
#### - We learned the importance of pacing ourselves and not getting caught up in small details. Focusing on the bigger picture and long-term vision is key to making meaningful progress

### What's next 
#### - Given more time, we aim to streamline the registration process for sellers, including background checks, and explore direct connections with local food banks. Additionally, we plan to enhance both the backend infrastructure and the UI/UX design to create a more polished and user-friendly experience
