## Welcome to our HackMIT 2024 project, EcoEats!

### Description 
##### - A resourceful online food market where people can donate or sell sealed & unexpired goods


### Inspiration
##### - Food waste and food insecurity harm communities, so we set out to create a sustainable solution that connects people to reduce waste while supporting those in need


### How we built it
##### - We built it using React, CSS, and Convex!!


### What's next 
##### - Given more time, we aim to streamline the registration process for sellers, including background checks, and explore direct connections with local food banks. Additionally, we plan to enhance both the backend infrastructure and the UI/UX design to create a more polished and user-friendly experience
